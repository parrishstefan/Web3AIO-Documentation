<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Web3AIO is an application that allows users to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It has multi-wallet support, real-time contract monitoring with a 0.1 response time, proxy usage, and webhook access, making it easy and efficient for users to manage their contracts.

Why we made it:
* In late 2021, the crypto-currency market exploded with many ways of increasing your wealth, one being NFTs or non-fungible tokens. There were exclusive NFTs with limited supply that if you were able to get your hands on them, you could sell for 10-100x your initial investment. 
* Getting your hands on these products were very difficult since you were competing with tens of thousands of other people trying to make a profit for themselves. Since the demand was so high compared to the supply, the owners of the NFT collections would only allow purchasing at a random time which is how we thought of creating Web3 AIO.
* Instead of having to sit at your computer for hours refreshing their website in hopes we had a chance at purchasing, we created an app that would do it for us. 

Web3 AIO would allow us at a press of a button to monitor these contracts for the sale to go live and instantly purchase NFTs as soon as they were available for the public. A few notable purchases made below with Web3 AIO.

* Purchased 10 GalacticApes at 0.08 ETH ($490.27 USD Value) each

  * Sold for 1.2 ETH ($3512.28 USD Value) each

  * Total Profit 11.2 ETH ($30,220.10 USD Value)

* Purchased 3 SwampVerse at 0.06 ETH ($246.02 USD Value) each

  * Sold for 0.35 ETH ($1468.00 USD Value) each

  * Total Profit 0.87 ETH ($3,665.95 USD Value)
